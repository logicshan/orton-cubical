Agda code accompanying PhD thesis: Cubical Models of
Homotopy Type Theory -- An Internal Approach" by Ian Orton.

This dataset was finalised in November 2018 by Ian Orton,
who was a PhD student at the University of Cambridge the
time. He may be contacted at ianorton@hotmail.com.

This dataset consists of numerous computerised proofs which
can be checked with the proof assistant Agda. The file
`root.agda` describes how these proofs are structured and
what is contained in each file. The structure of the files
is designed to match the structure of the PhD thesis.

These files were put together by Ian Orton, but build on
work done in collaboration with Andrew Pitts, Daniel Licata
and Bas Spitters.

The files which are imported by `chapter7.agda` require an
(at the time of writing) experimental branch of Agda known
as Agda-flat which can be installed using the following
commands:

git clone https://github.com/agda/agda
cd agda
git checkout flat
cabal update
cabal install --program-suffix=-flat

The file `root.agda` has been checked using the following
versions of Agda, with the approximate times taken to check
the entire file:
  - Agda 2.5.4 (with chapter7 commented out) in ~ 1 min
  - Agda-flat 2.6.0-1f943c9 (the whole file) in ~ 3 mins
